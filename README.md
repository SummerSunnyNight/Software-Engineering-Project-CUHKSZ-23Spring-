# Software-Engineering-Project-CUHKSZ-23Spring- 
## 0.**What does this Project do:**  
File "1.py" mutates the program, while the file "2.py" calculates the number of the undefined variable uses of the program.  
Detail in the "CSC4001_Spring_Project.pdf"  
## 1.**How to use the project:**    
Simple example:  
x = x + 1  
y = y + 1  
def foo():  
    x = 1  
If you want to test the python code above,just runs the project and types x = x + 1\ny = y + 1\ndef foo():\n    x = 1 in the command line.  

### Additional testcases provided in the folder TestcaseFor1py and Testcasefor2py   
    The result for 1.py can be easily predicted.    
    The result for 2.py may be little bit hard to predict since the testcases in the folder "Testcasefor2py" contains some corner cases.  
    According to the discussion of me and my friend, the final output for the testcases in the Testcasefor2py should be 0 3 3 1 2 3 2. (References only)
### You may also create your own testcases to test the project.

## 2.**Limitation of the project:**   
  Nested function definition not supported.  
  Loop and recursion not supported.  
  Some corner cases not considered.  
  
  Only successfully passed the testcases in the TestcaseFor1py and Testcasefor2py.
